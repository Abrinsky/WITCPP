LOLZ HOPE U DONT NEED HELP INSTALLING!

This is a program you can use alone or with friends, you can modify the text files that come with it to however you want.
Each of the text files includes a little help on how to edit them.
They will be in the folder you installed to, the default folder is C:/Program Files/Fortunes
The program uses the text files to output answers, so you can change the answers to be whatever you want, which can b fun if you put friends names in or whatever :D
ENJOY!
