#This is the harmful things/diseases file, basically things that can damage your health or otherwise kill you.
#The program will pick one of these at random :D
#If it picked "get in a car accident" it would say that, and lower your health by the number next to it.
#Whenever one of these happen your health drops, and when it reaches 0, you die.
